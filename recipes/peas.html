      <img src="./peas-pic.jpg" alt="very appetizing picture of mushy peas">

      <h3>Preamble</h3>
      <p>I'm full from the shrimp egg foo young, and I don't feel like making dinner tonight, kids, so you're getting mushy peas.</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>I don't feel like describing mushy peas.</p>
      
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <p>This is taken from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/50281/mushy-peas-i/">allrecipes.com</a> by the way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One 10 ounce package frozen green peas</li>
        <li><s>¼ cup heavy cream</s>
          <p>I actually like my peas to be as mushy as possible, so let's make that an even 1 cup.<p>
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teasppon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Let's also throw in 1 cup of water, just to make it good and mushy. Sink water is fine.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>steps</h3>
      <p>I have a splitting headache.</p>
