      <p>Yum.<p>

      <h3>Preamble</h3>
      <p>If you are anything like me, you are always craving a shrimp and an egg. Luckily, I have compiled the perfect recipe for Shrimp Egg Foo Young that I have not tried myself and that I took from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com">allrecipes.com</a>.

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Ripped directly from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/163370/shrimp-egg-foo-young/">https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/163370/shrimp-egg-foo-young/</a>, and vetted by myself:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/163370/shrimp-egg-foo-young/">
        <p>This egg foo young recipe includes a delicious sauce to put on top of the patties. This is a very special recipe acquired when I worked at a Chinese restaurant to pay for my red 1966 VW bug when in high school! The recipe card is tattered and spotted now, but the dish is the best egg foo young I have ever had. To serve, place egg patty over steamed rice and put the sauce on top.</p>
